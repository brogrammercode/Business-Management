`Consumers`
- add loading shimmer effect & submitting animation as well as page navigation
- add empty list illustration or something
- filter, search, update, delete, view
- for updating the fields, just update one by one not all at once as a form

`FUTURE IDEAS`
- after updation of consumer, make it popUntil to consumer_main_page and then again navigate to particular consumer detail page as well 
- If possible, for delivery panel make it cubit

`THOUGHTS`
- during building the page, in bloc builder for default returner, get first the data to show in the page and use the state conditioned bloc builder returners to act only for functions not to 
  show data
- Get only limited length of list of data for any list and also go with only recent or last week data
